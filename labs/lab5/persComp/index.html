    <h1>Catch the Spy</h1>
    <h2>
      Spot the moving spy and hover over them to catch them, get whole canvas
      onto screen then refresh, if you dont catch the spy in 5 seconds he is
      gone and refresh to restart.
    </h2>
    <h6>
      Everything here is intentional, the spy is a small black dot on a very
      dark background, its to add some challenge, trust me he is there, the
      coding says so.
